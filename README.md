Nowadays, I was learning golf every day, and suddenly I had an idea while playing golf. Can CNN classify sports?

First, I needed sports data, and I chose sports golf, baseball, soccer, and basketball.

I got datas from Google by using this method'https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/04/how-to-create-a-deep-learning-dataset-using-google-images/'

There is a sample of data per sports.
